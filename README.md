During this process I added a new device (Win10) and linked them up. When adding Win10 I had to set up IP ranges, set up a gate way and a DHCP server.LAN and firewall were configure through CLI over interface (10.128.10.1) This was done by setting the allowaccess and also the DHCP sever was enable on the LAN interface.Win10 was added to LAN network.
